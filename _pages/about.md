Mechanical Engineering Student 

Started my studies in [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/). Currently persuing a Master at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/) by the Double Degree agreement between USP and TUM.

Recipient of the AUCANI merit scholarship 

## Experience 
**Flight Control Laws** - Lilium 
Lilium is an innovative company developing the first electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) jet. Pushing engineering boundaries, the Lilium Jet has 16 flaps and 30 actuators to pursue hover and forward flight missions. 

Brief description of the addressed activities:
* Matlab tool to run Simulink models simulations.
    - Implementation of new features (e.g baseline comparison).
    - Robustness improvement to address different models.
* Support in the development of modelling envelopes using trim data.
* Non-linear simulations automatic criteria evaluation.
    - Lateral-directional and longitudinal-vertical control responses
    - Loads and rates thresholds violations.
    - Flap command and flap deflection conformity. 
* Jenkins Implementation to track Simulink Flight Control Systems (FCS) model changes.
    - Job to automatically compile FCS after changes.
    - Job to run predefined tests and update baseline. 
    - Job to periodically run a batch of tests and track progress with criteria evaluation.
* Simulink models compliance with software standards verification
* Change in the linear design pipeline when using tuning gains
    - Implement the use of tunable Matlab features to build closed-loop linear models 5x times faster 
    - Implement new features to the pipeline in order to allowed some user flexibility when choosing the closed-loop components.
